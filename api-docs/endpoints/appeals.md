**API URL**: ``https://fates-api.select-list.xyz``

**Widgets Documentation:** ``https://fates-lynx.select-list.xyz/widgets`` 

## Authorization

- **Bot:** These endpoints require a bot token. 
You can get this from Bot Settings. Make sure to keep this safe and in 
a .gitignore/.env. A prefix of `Bot` before the bot token such as 
`Bot abcdef` is supported and can be used to avoid ambiguity but is not 
required. The default auth scheme if no prefix is given depends on the
endpoint: Endpoints which have only one auth scheme will use that auth 
scheme while endpoints with multiple will always use `Bot` for 
backward compatibility

- **Server:** These endpoints require a server
token which you can get using ``/get API Token`` in your server. 
Same warnings and information from the other authentication types 
apply here. A prefix of ``Server`` before the server token is 
supported and can be used to avoid ambiguity but is not required.

- **User:** These endpoints require a user token. You can get this 
from your profile under the User Token section. If you are using this 
for voting, make sure to allow users to opt out! A prefix of `User` 
before the user token such as `User abcdef` is supported and can be 
used to avoid ambiguity but is not required outside of endpoints that 
have both a user and a bot authentication option such as Get Votes. 
In such endpoints, the default will always be a bot auth unless 
you prefix the token with `User`. **A access token (for custom clients)
can also be used on *most* endpoints as long as the token is prefixed with 
``Frostpaw``**

- **Special:** These endpoint employ their own authentication system (such as ``slwebset``)
